1. Enhancing the Communication Protocol
Optimize ESP-NOW and MAVLink Integration: Use ESP-NOW for inter-drone communication and MAVLink for precision flight control. Maintain minimal latency by ensuring efficient message parsing and prioritization in Raspberry Pi.
UWB Distance Protocols: Leverage UWB DW1000 for real-time positioning to prevent collisions and maintain formation integrity. Use trilateration algorithms to determine drone positions relative to the leader.
2. Flight Controller Integration
Parameter Management:
Develop functions in your GUI to set and retrieve parameters from the SpeedyBee F405 V4 using MAVLink commands (PARAM_SET and PARAM_REQUEST_READ).
Allow saving parameter profiles for rapid deployment in similar missions.
Mission Execution:
Automate shape formation based on geometric formulas (e.g., calculating vertices for squares, rectangles, etc.).
Ensure heading alignment for drones during shape formation using the yaw command.
3. GUI Development
Mission Planning Module:
Add an interactive map to visualize drone positions in real time using JS libraries like Leaflet or Mapbox.
Enable drag-and-drop functionality to set drone waypoints or formation points directly on the map.
Drone Settings Tab:
Include options for configuring altitude, distance thresholds, and velocity.
Display live telemetry (battery, GPS fix, heading, altitude, and velocity) in a dashboard format.
Autonomous Behavior Management:
Include UWB distance safety thresholds and collision avoidance settings.
Add a simulation mode to preview missions before execution.
Real-Time Updates:
Implement WebSocket or HTTP streaming for telemetry to ensure minimal delay in live updates.
4. Shape Formation Algorithm
Write a Python class for leader drone:
Calculate drone positions based on leaderâ€™s location using geometric transformations.
Broadcast positions to followers using ESP-NOW and confirm receipt.
Use MAVLink to guide followers to their respective positions.
5. Ball Pickup and Placement System
Ball Detection:
Stream camera footage to the laptop for image processing.
Use OpenCV or a lightweight neural network for object detection.
Command Flow:
Once the ball is detected, the GCS computes coordinates and sends commands to the leader drone.
The leader drone distributes tasks to the closest drone for pickup and others for cart positioning.
Mechanical Pickup:
Design and test a reliable gripper mechanism controlled by the flight controller or an auxiliary microcontroller.
6. Collision Avoidance
Implement a UWB-based collision avoidance system:
Continuously monitor inter-drone distances.
Broadcast "stop" or "adjust" commands if the distance falls below a threshold.
7. AI Integration (Future Goals)
For ball detection and autonomous decision-making, consider:
A centralized AI system on the GCS to offload computation.
Use frameworks like TensorFlow Lite or PyTorch for lightweight inference.
8. Testing and Debugging
Simulate missions using SITL (Software In The Loop) for ArduPilot.
Test individual modules (communication, telemetry, and missions) before full system integration.
Conduct outdoor tests with safety precautions for collision avoidance and fail-safes.
